## Ingredients

- 225g dried or fresh egg noodles
- 1 tbsp sesame oil, plus 1 tsp
- 100g boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into fine shreds
- 2½ tbsp groundnut oil
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 50g mangetout, finely shredded
- 50g Parma ham or cooked ham, finely shredded
- 2 tsp light soy sauce
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine or dry Sherry
- ½ tsp freshly ground white pepper
- ½ tsp golden caster sugar
- 2 spring onions, finely chopped


## Instructions

- Cook the noodles in a large pan of boiling water for 3-5 mins, then drain and put them in cold water. Drain thoroughly, toss them with 1 tbsp of the sesame oil and set aside.

- Combine the chicken with all the marinade ingredients and ½ tsp salt, mix well and then leave to marinate for about 10 mins.

- Heat a wok over a high heat. Add 1 tbsp of the groundnut oil and, when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the chicken shreds. Stir-fry for about 2 mins and then transfer to a plate. Wipe the wok clean. Reheat the wok until it is very hot, then add the remaining groundnut oil. When the oil is slightly smoking, add the garlic and stir-fry for 10 secs. Then add the mangetout and ham, and stir-fry for about 1 min.

- Add the noodles, soy sauces, rice wine or Sherry, pepper, sugar, spring onions and 1 tsp salt. Stir-fry for 2 mins. Return the chicken and any juices to the noodle mixture. Stir-fry for about 3-4 mins or until the chicken is cooked. Add 1 tsp sesame oil and give the mixture a few final stirs. Put on a warm platter and serve immediately.
