- Chop the potato into thin slices.
- In a heated wok, add in 4-5 tablespoons of oil, move around the wok, allow the oil spread evenly.
- When the oil is heating up, add in sliced potato.
- Add in couple of teaspoon of cumin seeds, stir well with potato slices.
- When the surface of the potato is getting dry, even a little bit ‘burnt’, it is done.
